How am I still alive?

My weapons were barely a match for the arsenal they seem to be developing.

Back when they first chased me I just managed to dock in the control area and close the impregnable alloy door before the nearest bot smashed into it. This was followed by others, almost as if they were suicide bots.

It was soon after I reported this that my boss ordered me to get off the planet. I wasn’t sure how long I was to be given before they destroyed it but it wouldn’t be long.

When he told me to get off the planet the phrase "Easier said than done" came to mind. I couldn’t use an entanglement transporter as the nearest receptor was three light years away, well out of the safety range.

The only way was to use the ship.

And it was still going... somehow.
