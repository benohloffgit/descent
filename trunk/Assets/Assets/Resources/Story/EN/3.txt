‘I’m alive. I’m alive.’ I screamed followed by a whispered ‘Just.’

I knew there was a long way to go yet and killing these security bots would become more and more difficult. I should know. It was me that allowed them to develop and reproduce whilst I was in the hologram-connection suite partying with college friends.

It was my job with Illicitus Prison Planets to take the bots from their initial setup and observe them through darwination, making any corrections necessary. A fairly easy task I assumed, even for a work-shy robotic neural scientist like me.

I reckoned as their initial programming, prior to the darwination process, had no instruction to harm, maim, stop or kill there couldn’t be any problem with letting them just get on with evolving. The nasty stuff was always left until they had evolved.

‘How wrong I was’ sprung to mind as I continued my escape. The planet’s computer informed me via the neural-link that a rocket launcher was concealed in the next protected chamber as I edged forwards.
