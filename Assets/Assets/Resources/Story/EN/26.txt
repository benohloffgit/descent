How I was still alive I have no idea but here I am.

I tried the planet's computer again and connected for about a second and a half before I sensed interference.

The Bots.

Had anyone ever imagined that these security devices could develop into something so sinister? I started to wonder about any information I was receiving from the Brain.

Could the bots take over the planet's computer?

They hadn't yet as the mini-map was still working fine but I needed to keep checking this. If the mini-map started to show incorrect cave layouts I would know they had control of the Brain.

If that happened I would be no more...
