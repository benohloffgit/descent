I am so close now I can almost feel the vacuum of space on my face.

Just a few more caves to get through and I could speed away from this nightmare.

But the Bots were swarming everywhere now with weapons that I couldn’t even imagine. As long as my shield and invincibility device hold I reckon escape would be possible.

This was the first time I actually allowed myself to believe I really could get away from here. If I could get hold of a detonation missile I would be able to destroy a group of bots with just one shot.

Hopefully that won’t be my last thought as I am blasted with some super-advanced Laser Ray.

I pushed out into the next cave system.
