I honestly don’t know how I am still alive. If only I could go back to the quantum world chamber.

The working period following the reverse hook-up I turned on my screen to see where the bots were and couldn’t find them. I remotely searched through the ever-changing cave system with a spotter-bot. I even sent gamma-ray search-fingers out.

Nothing.

I decided there must be a glitch in my system so thought the best thing to do was actually hunt them out physically. Docked alongside the control wing was the small maneuverable ship that I am now in again. I slammed the hatch and turned on the energy cells. I released from the control tower and headed on auto-pilot to the caves.

I wish I had made a break for it then. I reckon I may have stood a chance. But now...
