That cave was full of bots with weapons I had never even contemplated but the shield was doing its job. What would really help would be if I could find a condensed particle accelerator, or a booster as everyone called it. This would allow me to boost my acceleration when one of those bad-bots was onto me. And if I could find a phaser for my weapon system I reckoned I stood a chance.
