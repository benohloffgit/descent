Lucky. Lucky. Lucky.

I had dispatched some more evil machines but even my array of weaponry was starting to be ineffective. If I could find a Detonator Missile that would fit onto my launcher I would stand a chance.

I went back to when I was in control of the ship searching around for bots. Strangely I couldn't find any. I searched and searched leaving my bread-crumbs behind at strategic points.

Entering a new cave system I saw the most shocking sight that any human had probably ever witnessed. There were hundreds of bots floating around the cave pulsating. They all seemed to be surrounding a single bot that was pulsating even more violently.

They have a leader.

That was a few earth-days ago now and I reckoned they had evolved even further and multiplied exponentially.

Hopefully I was damaging their numbers.
