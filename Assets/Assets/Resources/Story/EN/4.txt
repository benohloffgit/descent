"No problem." I said as I hid away again, having dispatched numerous bots to the scrap-yard.

I had noticed that the further I progressed through the cave system the more potent the bots were becoming. Somehow the darwination process was continuing and they were developing, reproducing, and becoming more lethal. I would need more than a gun. The planet's computer (the Brain), which I was connected to, let me know that in the next cave system I could find a laser.

My ship also had a bread-crumb conducer. This is a device that can lay a marker anywhere in space, unaffected by any exterior force. When I enter a new cave system I lay these at the entrance so I know not to go through that tunnel again. I would go backwards by mistake if I didn't.

Laying these is not an easy task when you have an Phaser cannon being fired at you, I must say.

I carried on.
