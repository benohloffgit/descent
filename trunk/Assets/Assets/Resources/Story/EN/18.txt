I think my shield had gone for a while then. If one of those tin-Pikes had hit me then that would have been it.

After the dark energy wave had been pulsed throughout the planet I went in search of the particular Bat bot I had encountered earlier.  I found it near the entrance and homed in on its software. As soon as I tried to hook into its software the memory spiked again. It wouldn’t allow me access. It seemed to be behaving like an adolescent; an adolescent with a grudge. I’m sure it was my imagination but I felt hatred towards me.

I tried countless times to integrate with it before giving up and went in search of another series Bat bot. I saw one alone lurking near a small group which all seemed to be integrating with it. I tried to hook into its software. This time I only received a message in my head that no connection was available.

“Connect with this you psychos.” I shouted and sped into the next cave lasers blazing.
