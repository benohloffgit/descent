So going back a bit again... It was just after the failed programme reversal that I thought I should contact Illicitus and inform them of the situation that was developing.

A bleeper went off in my mind confirming connection and I heard the head of the prison authority before I saw him. His name was Mr. Benn. The man wasn't actually there. His image was just connected to my visual cortex which gave me the impression of having him stand in front of him.

"Hello Mr. Stuheart. What can I do for you?", Mr. Benn asked me.

"I have a problem."

"Go on."

I gulped. I was about to confess to my ineptitude.

My gulp was mirrored as I continued my escape...

"I can't take it anymore." I said as I limped into another hiding place. I reached for the bottle of Vitriol that I had jammed into my pocket prior to my escape and my mind went back to that chat with my boss.

"The bots have developed beyond my control." I had told the man.

"Not possible." Not really a very helpful reply. "I am interfacing with the programme to see what the situation really is."

"Not possible." He repeated and after a pause. "How long has this situation been transpiring?"

I wasn't sure due to my illicit activities in the hologram suite. I guessed. "Ten days."

"No. How long in their life cycle has this situation been out of control?" I guessed again "Maybe 250 lifetimes."

"What!"

"Okay 200 then."

"This is unacceptable." I didn't like the sound of that and made myself forget about it as I pushed out into the cave system again.
