‘That was the first lot taken care of,’ I thought as I wiped the sweat from my brow. My ship was undamaged but the defense shield had taken some serious punishment and without the gun I found in the last cave system I would definitely have been history.

I checked the gun was re-charging on the control panel and what state my shield was in. As I was fussing over the control screen it suddenly came to me - I had laid dark-energy pockets throughout the cave system to enable the patrol-bots to re-energise. This was in fact pure laziness on my part. Normally you would energise the bots individually whilst running analysis tests. Creating the dark-energy pockets had been a stroke of genius on my part and saved me hours of work a day.

If I could just fly into these areas I could align the energy vortex to ramp up my defense shield. ‘I wouldn’t last too long with these crazed bots everywhere and no shield,’ I thought and took a deep breath...
