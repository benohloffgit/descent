I thought I was dead twice then.

These bots were definitely upgraded versions of the ones I had seen gathering around their leader.

After I had witnessed the scary bot conference I slowly crept back out of sight and a cold sweat broke out all over my body. Then I noticed a huge energy surge detected by the planet’s brain and a single bot came into view. I hit the retrace programme on the bread-crumb conducer and sped away back to the supposed safety of the control area on auto. Checking my mapping system I saw that behind me were hundreds of bots slowly catching me.

They didn’t have weapons back then, like now...
