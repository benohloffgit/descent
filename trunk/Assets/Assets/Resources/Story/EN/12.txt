My ship hobbled to a new hiding place and my mind went back to my employer.
After several days of getting it in the neck from my boss he said. “You had better get off the planet and report in as soon as you have. We need to re-configure the planet.

I knew that meant – blow it to smithereens, including all the prisoners and me, I pondered, if I didn’t get off fast.

It sounded easy to get off the planet, but when you have out of control bots that are armed with laser cannons, quantum torpedoes or whatever else they have developed, then easy turns into impossible.

However just for a second I thought these bots are easier to deal with than my boss. I would no doubt be re-assigned to a garbage-vaporisation ship or a farm-planet which stunk its stink into you.

Oh well...
