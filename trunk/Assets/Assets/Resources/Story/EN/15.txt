"I'm getting better at this." I said to the bottle of vitriol as I slunk into the shadows.

These bots had a memory that only they themselves had access to. It was really so each individual bot could learn its way around the complex and the mapping would be individual to each bot. So as I tried to get the bot to blow itself up the bot started to think. This in itself was not terribly alarming as the bot is always accessing its SC memory. But what was alarming was the spike of energy the SC memory took. I brought a visual up on the hologramatic display of a bot hanging in space with its back to me. I walked around the individual and as I circled I felt more and more uneasy. The bot didn't move but again the SC memory was spiking through the roof.

"Off" I said out loud and the hologram wound itself up and disappeared. I went back to the screen showing the location of the bot and found it was now looking straight at me.

I shuddered with the memory and headed out to meet the next set wondering if that one was waiting for me in the shadows.
