# descent

My attempt at making a Descent like game in which you can fly with six degrees of freedom in a procedurally generated cave system and fight AI driven enemies. Made in Unity3D V3 in C#.

Needs to be migrated to current Unity version.

You can download a playable version for Windows or Mac from:
