The bots were getting more dangerous than I could imagine, but I was just managing to fight them off.

Going back again to the darwination mess up... The next working period I again looked at the Bat class of bot and tried to make it blow itself up by dropping a mine next to itself. Again it refused to do it. This time though the bot turned and sped away from me on one of its degrees of freedom. I tried to stop it and make it return to its previous position. It refused, SC memory spiking all over the place.

It felt like a battle of wills.

I lost.

Hopefully in the caves I would win...
