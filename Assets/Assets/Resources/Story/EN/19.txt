The Pike bots had morphed into something even worse. These things would be indestructible within hours I reckoned. If I could find a Gauss Annihilator then I would have a serious advantage. These are magnetically based weapons that break down the target into its component molecules, layer by layer.

About an hour after I gave up trying to hook into the Bat series, and as I was closing the attempted connection, it suddenly hooked-up its software to my system. "How the hell did that happen?"

The hooking system had been built as a one way only bridge between software entities. The SC memory spiked as did my brain. I felt a sort of suck before I pulled the plug. I honestly think the bot tried to see what I was thinking.

“Now I am spooked.” I took a vitriol relaxer and decided to have a small holiday of my own in the quantum world chamber. A room where you could visit any part of the cosmos, at any time in history.

I wish I could take myself there now rather than heading into almost certain death.
