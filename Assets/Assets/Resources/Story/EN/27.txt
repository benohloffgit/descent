These Bots are now nearly indestructible. But I am getting closer and closer to the final cave. I must have dispatched hundreds of them by now and I am sure they are not pleased. Have they developed emotion?

During my studies I was taught how to upload basic emotions into the neural system of a digital form of life. But had these bots taken it futher with their unchecked evolution and maybe they had even developed a sociopathâ€™s type of emotion.

I wondered if they had somehow intercepted the signal from my boss and had realised that they were to be destroyed as soon as I was off the planet.

After I had completed my studies I would not have believed this possible. But now nothing surprised me about these killers.

If I could pick up an invincibility device I reckoned I stood a chance. The bots were so numerous now that without one I would definitely be toast.
