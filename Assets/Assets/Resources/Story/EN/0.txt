How the hell did I end up in this situation?

I tried to ignore the fact that I knew the answer as I dropped into the control seat of the only escape ship.

Luckily I had trained years before on how to operate this standard ZMR1304 orbital-escaper. I knew that I had to navigate my way through different cave systems unlocking sections using virtual keys. Each key was in fact a point in space whose co-ordinates would reveal a code; and I knew in each cave 2 sets of co-ordinates would be required. I flicked the virtual conversion switch, which would give me a visual representation of each key. I just needed to fly to that co-ordinate and my ship would store the code.

Also I needed weapons and defense capabilities. These I knew could be picked up as I went in areas protected against security bots. In each cave system there would be a secret chamber with a logic key needed to gain access. This was designed so security bots wouldnâ€™t have the intellectual dexterity to access the weapons.

So here goes...
